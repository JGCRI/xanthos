        episode of the amount by which the hydrological variable fell short of the
        drought threshold.  If q_0(t) is the (possibly time variable) threshold, and
        t_0 is the start of the current drought episode, then

        Severity is also defined to be zero for a grid cell that is not currently
        under drought conditions.

        Intensity is the average severity over a drought period.  I = S/D.  It is
        defined to be (you guessed it) zero for a grid cell not currently under
        drought conditions.
